## Super early in development

This repo is super early in development as of now I dont even support simple `insert` command.

As of now I am working on core features and supporting every command from `supabase` will take time.

## React Supabase

This is repo is client library for [supabase_io](https://supabase.io/).

As of now I am aim to provide these features

- [x] Caching
- [x] Retry Failed requests
- [x] Automatically refetch the requests
- [x] Background Refetching
- [x] Finer control over state-updates with `shouldComponentUpdate`
- [x] Dependent Requests
- [x] Prefetch Requests
- [ ] Authentication

**Note: The list is not comprehensive list of all features**

# Getting started

## Installation

As I mentioned the repo is in super early life of development as a result I still have not published it in `npm`. So the only way you can use this `repo` is to clone it.
