## Super early in development

This repo is super early in development as of now I dont even support simple `insert` command.

As of now I am working on core features and supporting every command from `supabase` will take time.

## React Supabase

This is repo is client library for [supabase_io](https://supabase.io/).

As of now I am aim to provide these features

-[X] Caching -[X] Retry Failed requests -[X] Automatically refetch the requests -[X] Background Refetching -[X] Finer control over state-updates with `shouldComponentUpdate` -[ ] Dependent Requests -[ ] Prefetch Requests

**Note: The list is not comprehensive list of all features**

# Getting started

## Installation

As I mentioned the repo is in super early life of development as a result I still have not published it in `npm`. So the only way you can use this `repo` is to clone it.
